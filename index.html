            <p>I'm a 21 year old Romanian Computer Science student, passionate about most of the fields from this domain. I currently work as a Software Developer for IBM, and primarily use Java to earn my bread, but have also experience with other languages (such as C, C++, Python, PHP and SQL) and frameworks (such as Django).</p>
            <p>I tend to sometimes work on my own free, open-source projects that someone (especially devs - because that was my intended audience) may benefit from, but until this moment they could only do so by paying for that product.</p>
            <p>I also tend to work on projects that try to "mimic" existing free software, but simplifies their usability because <b>who the hell would want to wait for Visual Studio to open an entire project, just to edit a certain comment in the code?</b></p>

                Also, if you're using a phone to see the contents of this website (which I cannot validate, because this is just a static page), I'm sorry for you :) I didn't have time to optimize it for phone and, to be honest, I will probably never do so.
